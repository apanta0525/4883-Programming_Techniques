## Assignment 10 - Everything's Dijkstra
#### Due: 09-29-2022 (Thursday @ 11:00 a.m.)

### Overview


Dijkstra's algorithm is an easy implementation of a shortest path between a source node `U`, and a sink node `V`. Dijkstra's inherently calculates the shortest path from `U` to all other nodes, but don't confuse this with an `All Pairs Shortest Path` algorithm like [Floyd-Warshall's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm). There is another single source shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's called the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm). Its a little slower, but it can handle negative edge weights, unlike Dijkstra's which cannot.

### Choose 2 From the Following

- [929 - Number Maze](https://onlinejudge.org/external/9/929.pdf)	
- [1112 - Mice and Maze](https://onlinejudge.org/external/111/1112.pdf)
- [10389 - Subway](https://onlinejudge.org/external/103/10389.pdf)
- [10986 - Sending email](https://onlinejudge.org/external/109/10986.pdf)

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A10` in your `assignments` folder.
- For each problem pick, create a `subfolder` in `A10` with the problem number as the folder name.
- Place the pdf, your solution(s) code, and any input files you used in this folder.
- Make sure you create an acceptable [README](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) file for this project (presentation is everything!)
- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.
