## Presentations - Be Interested!
#### Due: Various Dates From Nov 1<sup>st</sup> - Dec 6<sup>th</sup> 

Being interested in the problem is the first thing to help your presentation be successful. Pick a problem you hate or totally don't get, then the presentation may struggle. Pick a problem you really like, but possibly don't get all the way, it will still come off as interesting.

### Helpful Tips

- Choose a problem that you think is interesting. It does not have to be a UVA problem, but it does need to fit in the category of competitive programming or interview questions. 
- The problem should not be of the caliber of those listed in the "easy breezy" assignment.
- Explain the overall problem. Usually the description does not help üôÇ So cut through the wordiness and try to identify the core proble (e.g. this is really a graph problem needing a shortest path).
- Give an overall synopsis of what "type" of solution you think is necessary.

  1. Complete Search
    - Iterative 
    - Recursive 
  2. Divide and Conquer
  3. Greedy
  4. Dynamic Programming


- Identify sticking points and things that possibly gave you "issues". This is my favorite topic, as I tend to think one way for a while until I have a realization that gets me to the solution. (e.g. "This problem sounded like a shortest distance problem, but It ended up not needing any data structure but just some arithmetic!")
- If you can talk about complexity, do so (e.g. my solution seems to be O(n<sup>2</sup>) or linear or whatever). But don't stress! This is not required as we will discuss as as class.
- Try and discuss anything you did in which you tried to speed up the problem. However, if you were just struggling with solving it, then no worries.
- Your talk can go from 10 minutes to however long it takes. If the problem is interesting, it might spark a discussion that could last a while. 
- If you finish in 10 to 15 minutes with no questions than that is ok. However, I will look at your materials used for the presentation, and grade you on what I perceive your effort level was. You don't have to totally understand your presentation problem to get an A, you just need to have put in effort to try and understand, but also show the class your journey into solving said problem.

## Deliverables

- Create a folder in your github repo that is named `A13` for your materials.
- At the bare minimum, the problem pdf should be in there.
- What I would like to see is any code you created or discussed in solving the problem. (Having said that, solving the problem is not mandatory.) 
- I also want a markdown page (README.md) laying out your discussion with code snippets, discussion topics, and the like. 
- At a minimum, I will want you to describe a solution category that you think will work in obtaining a solution to your problem, with some justification and commentary.
