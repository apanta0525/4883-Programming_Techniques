## Assignment 6 - Hardwood Species
#### Due: 09-08-2022 (Thursday @ 11:00 a.m.)

### Overview

[PDF](p10226.pdf)


### Hardwood Species

- The trauma of reading this input is still with me. 
- However, this is a good example of using STL Maps Vectors and Pairs as part of the solution.

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A06` in your `assignments` folder.
- Place the pdf, your solution code, and any input files you used in this folder.
- Make sure you create an acceptable [README](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) file for this project (presentation is everything!)
- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.
