## Assignment 12 - Everything is Not Backtracking
#### Due: 10-25-2022 (Thursday @ 11:00 a.m.)

### Overview

We looked at 2 "backtracking" problems both of which do not really require backtracking.... but lets do them anyway.

### Problems

Back to the 8 Queens: [11085](https://onlinejudge.org/external/110/11085.pdf)
Sudoku: [12988](https://onlinejudge.org/external/129/12988.pdf)

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `A12` in your `assignments` folder.
- For each problem pick, create a `subfolder` in `A12` with the problem number as the folder name.
- Place the pdf, your solution(s) code, and any input files you used in this folder.
- Make sure you create an acceptable [README](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) file for this project (presentation is everything!)
- Commit this content to your github repo by the due date.
